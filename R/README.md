# Methods implemented in R

- **/Resampling** - code for Resampling data to different extents (grid sizes)
- **/bias-correction-methods** - bias correction methods implemented in R
- **/comparing-r-and-python** - Comparing various pipeline aspects between R and python

<!--
### R

In the `R` subdirectory you can find code for replicating the different data processing and debiasing steps as above, along with comparisons of methods between the two languages.
- **bias-correction-methods** for bias correction (debiasing) methods available specifically in `R` libraries
- **comparing-r-and-python** for replication of resampling and reviewing the bias correction methods applied in `python`.
- **Resampling** for resampling the HADsUK datasets from 1km to 2.2km grid in `R`.
